# Weather Data Pipeline 🌤️

This is a beginner-friendly data engineering project where I build an end-to-end pipeline that:
- Calls the OpenWeatherMap API
- Extracts weather data for a list of cities
- Cleans and stores it as a CSV
- (Later: Loads to BigQuery)

## 📌 Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Git & GitHub
- (Upcoming: Google BigQuery)

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/weather-data-pipeline.git
   cd weather-data-pipeline


## 📊 BigQuery Output

Data is uploaded to Google BigQuery:
- Dataset: `weather_data`
- Table: `daily_weather`
